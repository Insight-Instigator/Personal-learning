# Steps in Rendering a Web Page

## 1. DNS Resolution
The browser looks up the domain name (e.g., www.example.com) using the Domain Name System (DNS) to find its corresponding IP address.

## 2. TCP/IP Connection
Using the IP address, the browser establishes a connection with the web server through the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), ensuring reliable data transfer.

## 3. HTTP Request
The browser sends an HTTP (or HTTPS) request to the server, asking for the specific web page or resource.

## 4. Server Response
The web server processes the request and sends back the appropriate response, usually including an HTML document, along with other resources like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

## 5. Browser Rendering
The browser parses the HTML, constructs the Document Object Model (DOM), applies CSS for styling, executes JavaScript, and finally renders the fully interactive web page on the screen.
